separated sentences.

Logical Steps:
1. A user inputs a paragraph.
2. The program runs user input into the function sentence_scan().
3. The function checks the paragraph for begining with a capital letter or number.
4. The function then checks for a ".", "?", or "!"
5. If both are met the string is separated from the rest.
6. Then, the function checks for a space and another sentence after.
7. The process is repeated until the whole string is checked for setences.
8. The program prints the length of the list of strings or number of sentences.
9. Finally, the program print each string the original was split into.

Program Description:
This program sells 20 tickets while tracking the number of buyers. Each buyer can purchase up to 
4 tickets and can only purchase tickets that are left. Then the program displays the number of 
buyers. The purpose of the program is to sell 20 tickets and count the number of buyers.
---
Logical Steps:
1. Create the accumlating variables TicketCount and BuyerCount
2. The program checks if there is more than one ticket left
3. The program asks how many ticket the user would like to purchase.
4. The amount of tickets the buyer is purchasing is inputed
5. The program calculates the tickets remaining if the transaction is complete.
6. The program checks if the buyer is 5 or more tickets
7. The program checks if the tickets remaining is greater than -1
8. If the program passes both checks then the transaction is completed and the TicketCount is set to the remaining tickets
9. If the program failed a check then it displays an error and restarts the transaction
10. The program adds to the buyer count
11. Once all 20 tickets are sold the buyer count is displayed

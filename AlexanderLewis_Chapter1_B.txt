Program Description:
The program simulates a magic 8 ball. The program creates a file of 12 random responses
to a yes or no question and reads the txt file onto a list. The purpose of the program
is to answer basic yes or no questions in a random manner.
---
Logical Steps:
1. Creates a file "8ball_responses.txt" and writes 12 yes or no responses to it.
2. The program reads the file onto a list.
3. The function "answer" creates a random value 0 through 11 and selects that line from the list.
4. A while loop asks the user if they want to use the magic 8 ball
5. The function answer is called printing a random response
6. The while loop is executed again until they answer "n"
